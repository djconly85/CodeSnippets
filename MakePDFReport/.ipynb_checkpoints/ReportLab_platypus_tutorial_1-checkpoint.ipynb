      "    Each PageTemplate has a procedure for drawing the \"non-flowing\" part of the page\n",
      "    (for example the header, footer, page number, fixed logo graphic, watermark, etcetera) and\n",
      "    a set of Frames which enclose the flowing part of the page (for example the paragraphs,\n",

      "    A document is built when a DocumentTemplate is fed a sequence of Flowables.\n",
